# Data Mining - PIMA
## Overview
Here we present our final paper for the data mining 1 course on the Pima (Diabetes Detection) dataset
## Task 1: Data Understanding
* Data Semantics
* Assessing data quality (missing values, outliers)
## Task 2: Clustering
### Clustering Analysis by K-means
* Choice of attributes and distance function
* Identification of the best value of k
* Characterization of the obtained clusters
### Analysis by density-based clustering
* Choice of attributes and distance function
* Study of the clustering parameters
* Characterization and interpretation of the obtained clusters
### Analysis by hierarchical clustering
* Choice of attributes and distance function
### Conclusion for the different clustering approaches used.
## Task 3: Association Rules Mining
* Frequent patterns extraction with different values of support and different types
* Discussion of the most interesting frequent patterns
* Association rules extraction with different values of confidence
* Discussion of the most interesting rules
* Use the most meaningful rules to replace missing values and evaluate the accuracy
* Use the most meaningful rules to predict if the diabetes is detected and evaluate the accuracy
## Task 4: Classification
1. Learning of different decision trees with different parameters and gain formulas with the object of maximizing the performances
   * Gini gain
   * Entropy gain
2. Decision trees validation with test and training set
  * Entropy gain
3. Discussion of the best prediction model
  * KNN
  * Decision Trees
4. Decision trees interpretation
